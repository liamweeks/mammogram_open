# mammogram_classifier

This neural network predicts abnormalities in mammograms. The test/train dataset can be retrieved from [here](http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html). This [PyTorch Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html)
tutorial was very helpful when making the model.
